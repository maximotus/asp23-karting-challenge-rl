# This package handles the learning of agents in the domain of the karting challenge.
# It is just a first draft and should somehow include sub-packages and/or modules regarding
#   - the learning of the agent,
#   - the interaction (interface) of that agent with the environment and
#   - the extraction, preparation, buffering etc. of the necessary data.
